1. Buffer Bombs
----

A "buffer bomb" is an executable bomb, called "./bufbomb", that is
solved using a buffer overflow attack (exploit).  In this lab,
students are asked to alter the behavior of a buffer bomb (called
bufbomb) via five increasingly difficult levels of exploits.

The levels are called smoke (level 0), fizz (level 1), bang (level 2),
boom (level 3), and kaboom (level 4), with smoke being the simplest
and kaboom being the most difficult.

2. Solving Buffer Bombs
----
Each exploit involves reading a sequence of bytes from standard input
into a buffer stored on the stack. Students encode each exploit string
as a sequence of hex digit pairs separated by whitespace, where each
hex digit pair represents a byte in the exploit string. The program
"hex2raw" converts these strings into a sequence of raw bytes, which
can then fed to the buffer bomb:
 
    unix> cat exploit.txt | ./hex2raw | ./bufbomb -u <userid>

Each student works on an identical buffer bomb, but the solution to
the individual phases is a function of each student's userid.  Thus,
students must develop the solution on their own and cannot use the
solutions from other students.

The solution to each phase is unique for each student because it
typically involves the manipulation on the runtime stack of a unique
"cookie" computed from the userid by the "makecookie" program:

    unix> ./makecookie bovik
    0x1005b2b7
